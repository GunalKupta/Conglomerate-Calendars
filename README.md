# Conglomerate-Calendars

I developed this web app because I use Google Calendar. A lot. For almost all aspects of my life. I have a Google Calendar for my class schedule, one for all extracurricular student orgs, two for work, one for personal events, and even one for my cousin's upcoming wedding. Unfortunately, in order to share my whole schedule with my partner, I would have to share each Google calendar individually and they would need to click about six different checkboxes to see my entire schedule. Enter, this app.

Using this web app, my partner can click a button and immediately update a conglomerated calendar with all events for the next few weeks. The conglomerated calendar contains copies of events from all my different calendars in one place so that my partner only needs to click one checkbox on Google Calendar to see my entire schedule.

The conglomerated calendar also updates every hour, so the web app is not necessary unless the most updated schedule needs to be viewed on the conglomerate calendar.
